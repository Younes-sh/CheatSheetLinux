	cat wordlist.txt (or whatever you named it)
	
Generating Wordlist of Specific Length:

		–auth_pass: Authentication password.
			cewl http://192.168.1.105/dvwa/login.php --auth_type Digest --auth_user admin --auth_pass password -v
			cewl http://192.168.1.105/dvwa/login.php --auth_type basic --auth_user admin --auth_pass password -v
